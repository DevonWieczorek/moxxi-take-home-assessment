This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

## Design Decisions

### Routing
- Use one static container to be the main "shell" of the user onboarding flow.
- Use Next's file-based routing to navigate from step to step.
- Use `useRouter` hook to programmatically navigate between steps after passing validation.

```tsx
import { useRouter } from 'next/router'

export default function Home() {
  const router = useRouter()
  
  const handleClick = () => {
    router.push('/about')
  }
  
  return <button onClick={handleClick}>About</button>
}

```
